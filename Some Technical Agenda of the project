- DAL folder (Contains requests to DB and any logic related to DB):
-- XXX.Data
-- XXX.Data.Tests
- Domain folder (On this level is not allowed to have any kind of requests to DB, only DAL level must contain DB requests; domain level contains business logic):
-- XXX.Domain
-- XXX.DomainTests
- Web API Controller (must be as much as possible spitted to simplest request methods SOLID principles)
- Web (Angular/Angular 2) – front-end
- Common (here we are going to store all help models)
- Infrastructure (here will be all related features to Azure)
- Integration folder (optional)

Technologies: 
Application must be built according SOLID Principles
DB: MSSQL vs NoSQL
Back-end: NLog, Unity, Web API 2, CQRS, NUnit, NSubstitute, Microsoft Azure
Front-end: Angular/Angular 2, Bootstrap X
